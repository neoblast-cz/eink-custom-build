I have a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W with connected waveshare eink display. I used to use a deployed app developed from this github...

https://github.com/fatihak/InkyPi

but once I tried to update it it stopped working for me. I would like to develop my own version that would allow me to install much simpler version and potentially make it my own. 

I would like my eink be able to display my calendar and circle photos and being able that I add through Claud Code more modules in the future

Ideally there would be similar UI as I had on InkyPi
